              <h1 style= "color:#00BFFF;">What is Quantum Spark Charger?</h1>
              <p style= "color:white;"><big>How many of us have ever thought about what would happen if we did not have to change our phone's battery every now and then?
              How much money would have been saved for us if we did not have to buy a new battery every year or two?</big></p>
              <p style= "color:white;"><big>Quantum Spark Charger is a project that will change our lives forever once it is finalized.</big></p>
              <p style= "color:white;"><big>We all spend hundreds of dollars on our phones, not because we are insane, but because in the 21st century,
              our lives depend on them. Instead of going to the bank and waiting in line, our bank transactions could be done online with our phones. 
              Instead of driving our cars for hours, or paying for a flight to travel to another city/country, our meetings can all be done using our phones.</big></p>
              <p style= "color:white;"><big>We save a lot of time and money by using our phones. But what we do not realize is that we spend a lot of money on our phones as well.
              And we usually only use them for a couple of years before throwing it away in order to buy a new one. But what is the main reason that causes us to throw our phones away?
              Durability. A phone's durability is a major fact while considering to buy a phone. A phone's battery usually gets worn out after a year and starts to lose a bit of its durability.
              By the second year, it is good for nothing! This is when people usually tend to throw their phones away and buy a new one.</big></p>
              <p style= "color:white;"><big>Quantum Spark Charger is the solution to this problem. With our products being put to use, less money would be wasted.</big></p>
              <h1 style= "color:#00BFFF;">What Does Quantum Spark Charger Exactly Do?</h1>
              <p style= "color:white;"><big>The Spark Charger connects to the phone, and after its first connection, it works like a WiFi. Using its Raspberry Pi, 
              the charger receives a message from the phone saying that the phones need to be charged. Once the message is received, the Wireless charger turns on and starts to charge the phone.
              Once the phone reaches 100%, another notification will be sent to the charger. Using the Raspberry Pi, the charger turns off. The Quantum Spark Charger
              is going to last at least for 3 years.
